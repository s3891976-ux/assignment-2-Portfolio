                                <p>Choking occurs when a foreign object obstructs the airway, potentially leading to
                                    unconsciousness
                                    within 3–5 minutes
                                    and, in severe cases, brain damage or death due to oxygen deprivation.

                                    Immediate first aid, commonly involving abdominal thrusts and back blows, is crucial
                                    to saving
                                    lives. However, many
                                    people lack awareness of this life-saving procedure, and the standard method is not
                                    always
                                    suitable for specific groups,
                                    such as pregnant individuals or those with obesity.

                                    To address this gap, our project develops an interactive infographic tutorial
                                    designed to raise
                                    public awareness and
                                    provide step-by-step, adaptable guidelines for responding to choking emergencies.

                            <p>The tutorial begins with the main character (the user) starting their day like any other,
                                grabbing a
                                fast food meal on a
                                regular morning. Just as they happily receive their order, chaos strikes: a man nearby
                                suddenly
                                starts choking on his
                                food. In that critical moment, the user is forced to act quickly — either step in to
                                save him, or
                                watch as he collapses.</p>

                                <p>In this project, I want to express the feeling that I have recently had. The feeling
                                    of
                                    EMPTINESS. The hole that lingers
                                    in me and is eating me alive, time runs funny, sometimes it feels like already
                                    stopped,
                                    but
                                    sometimes it's really fast.
                                    At some point, I feel like the world is not real anymore; it feels like a dream,
                                    everything
                                    is
                                    just repeating, and
                                    something just feels slightly off.

                                    From that feeling, I believed that the concept "Liminal space" can represent the
                                    best
                                    for
                                    this
                                    project. Liminal space
                                    will have the vibe of repeated emptiness, and too perfect to be real; it can be a
                                    memory, a
                                    dream. It can also be an old
                                    website, a Wallpaper, the loading bar that never reaches 100%, a melody, or a sudden
                                    silence
                                </p>

                            <p>A liminal space, literally meaning “threshold” (from the Latin limen), is the space in
                                between.
                                It’s
                                not where you were,
                                and not yet where you’re going. It’s the hallway between rooms, the pause between
                                breaths,
                                the
                                moment after something
                                ends but before you understand what begins</p>
